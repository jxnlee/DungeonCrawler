# Instructions
1. Go to `main/main/Launcher.java` and run the file
2. Use arrows to move, and `Q` to attack
3. Slay enemies and/or move through rooms to increase score

# Other Features
* You can go through as many rooms as you want and can play as many rounds as you want
* Enemies will spawn at random amounts and random locations in each room
* Enemies in the next room will have an increased movement speed and attack, this represents the "difficulty" of each subsequent level
* When enemies attack you, your health will decrease
* When leveling up, your maximum health increases and you recover to full health
* When you are defeated, the tally of your scores will be shown with the highest score at the top

# To be implemented in the future...
* Animations are inconsistent, at the time we didn't get to finish:
  * change the direction entities are facing depending on the direction they are heading in
  * animate the user attacking enemies (however, we managed to show when enemies attack the user)
  * allow for more fluid animations
* Allow for more gameplay mechanics and difficulty scaling to make it more interesting for the user
* Make the GUI easier to use and appealing
